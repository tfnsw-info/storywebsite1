                        <p>The story "How water got to the plains" is a story about how water got to the plains. It is part of the stories of the Butchalla people of K'Gari (Fraser Island). </p>

                         <p>The children thousands of years ago thus learnt that there was not always availability of water on mainland Australia as there is on K'Gari.</p>
